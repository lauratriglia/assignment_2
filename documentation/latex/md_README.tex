In this repository you will find a package required for the construction of an interface whose the scope is to take commands from the user and execute them. The possible commands are\+: 1) Reach a random target 2) Choose a target among some possibilities which are (-\/4,-\/3);(-\/4,2);(-\/4,7);(5,-\/7);(5,-\/3);(5,1) 3) Follow the wall 4) Stop the robot

\subsection*{Prerequisites}

To execute successfully the code, there are required two other package. Clone the following repository in you workspace\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/CarmineD8/slam_gmapping}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/\+Carmine\+D8/slam\+\_\+gmapping}
\item \href{https://github.com/CarmineD8/final_assignment}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/\+Carmine\+D8/final\+\_\+assignment}
\end{DoxyItemize}

After the clonation of each package, do a catkin\+\_\+make.

\subsection*{Nodes}

\subsubsection*{\hyperlink{interface_8py}{interface.\+py}}

It takes the commands from the user and execute them

\subsubsection*{random\+\_\+service}

It generate the random target required for the first command

\subsection*{How the node communicate to each other}

You can find in the doc directory, the ros\+\_\+graph -\/$>$ it shows how the node communicate to each othere

\subsection*{How to run the code\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item As first step it is necessary to run a command to create the master 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 roscore & 
\end{DoxyCode}

\item As second step run the simulation space with 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 roslaunch final\_assignment simulation\_gmapping.launch
\end{DoxyCode}

\item As third step in another shell use the command to run the launch move\+\_\+base 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 roslaunch final\_assignment move\_base.launch
\end{DoxyCode}

\item As last step, in another shell, use the command to run the interface 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 roslaunch triglia\_final\_assignment assignment2.launch
\end{DoxyCode}
 
\end{DoxyItemize}
